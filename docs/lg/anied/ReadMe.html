<span style='mso-bookmark:Introduction'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Ink AniEd
is an animation tool based around Microsoft�s Ink architecture. The goal is to
create an animation tool which is easy and intuitive to use, and allows the user
to quickly create animations which can be used for any number of tasks, from
prototyping moving GUIs, to storyboarding for movies, to creating your own
cartoons. It was developed both as a standalone animation tool, and as a
Windows Control that can be easily integrated into any application using the
.Net Framework. And while AniEd was designed for the Tablet PC, and contains
certain features only available on the Tablet PC, it will run with little
noticeable difference on almost any computer with the .Net Framework.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>In <span
class=GramE>it�s</span> standalone form, AniEd is a revolutionary step in
animation, allowing for the greatest amount of quality animation, based on a
small amount of user input. Specifically designed for the Tablet PC AniEd�s
user interface makes bringing your Ink drawings to life as easy as cut and
paste. All the normal Inking features which you know <span class=GramE>and</span>
love, are fully available to be applied to any single frame of animation. This
means you can copy and paste frames to and from other documents allowing you to
make animations as easily as you can think them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>As a
component for other .Net applications, AniEd can be used as any other Control,
and uses a few simple functions to manage it (like <span class=GramE>Play(</span>),
Pause() and the Time and <span class=SpellE>UseEditor</span> properties, which
make creating your own animation editor or player a piece of cake). Also, the
AniEd control gives you access to an Ink object which represents the current
frame being viewed, this allows you to perform any normal Inking operation just
as you would on any other Ink object. Using the AniEd control is recommended
because it simplifies almost all operations to one or two simple function <span
class=GramE>calls,</span> however the architecture also allows you to make your
own animation controls using a series of structures similar to the Ink class
diagram. For instance you have <span class=SpellE>StrokePath</span> (to
represent a Stroke through time), and <span class=SpellE>InkPath</span> (which
represents a set of Strokes though time).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=howtouseit><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>How
to Use It<o:p></o:p></b></a></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:howtouseit'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>First of
all, AniEd has been designed to be easy to use, and if you just follow these
simple examples you�ll be up and animating in no time:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Okay, when
you first start you should see a blank page. Draw a single line on it using
your pen tip or left mouse button. Now that we�ve got a line, try dragging the
�time bar� at the bottom of the screen until it says �Time = 2�. This means
that you�ve gone ahead in time to 2 seconds from the first drawing. Now click the
line you drew before, you�ll notice that a yellow border is drawn around it.
Now draw another squiggly line, and you�ll notice it replaces the one you
highlighted. Now hit the Stop button <span class=GramE>( [</span>] ), this sets
you back to Time = 0. Now hit the Play button <span class=GramE>( &gt;</span>
), and you�ll see your first stroke blend into your second stroke. Quickly
press the Pause <span class=GramE>( |</span> | ) or Stop button to stop the
animation from going on for ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>What
happened here was that you drew what your animation looked like at Time = 0,
and what it looked like at Time = 2, then when you hit Play, the program went
from 0 to 2 and worked out what it imagines the line would look like in
between. You�ll find that it�s generally pretty good at guessing. These
drawings are commonly known as �key frames� to animators, and are the basis for
most animation techniques.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>You can
also change the color or width of any <span class=GramE>stroke,</span> and the
system will automatically fade between colours and width as it�s playing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>A little
more useful task: Set the time to 0 using the �time bar�, and then draw a stick
figure (so a head, a body, legs, arms etc.). Now set the �time bar� to some
time ahead of 0, let�s say 4 seconds. Now click on the first part of the stick
figure that you drew, and draw it again somewhere else. You will notice that
once you�ve drawn the new position, the next part of the stick figure that you
drew will automatically be selected. This means you can then also draw that
part in <span class=GramE>it�s</span> new position. In this way, you see how as
long as you are doing drawings in a specific order (which most people do anyway),
you can easily update a sketch to a new time and place, and make a cool looking
animation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Keep in
mind, that you can also move the �time bar� to between two sketches, and redraw
the sketch there as well, there really are no limitations on this. If you draw
a sketch at any time, it will only appear at or after that time. So if you draw
a sketch at 4 seconds, you will only see it after the 4<sup>th</sup> second of
animation (you can also make sketches stop at a certain time, as will be
discussed later).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>You can
also move, and modify sketches. To do this, first select them, which means draw
a loop around them using either the �barrel switch� on your pen, or the right
mouse button on your <span class=GramE>mouse.</span> Just hold down that
button, and draw a sort of outline of the strokes you wish to selected (this is
known as the lasso). Once you�ve selected the strokes, you can drag them
around, and perform all sorts of operations on them which you can find in a pop-up
menu which you get by either right clicking on them, or taping them with your
pen while holding down the barrel button.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>There are
of course a lot of other things you can do with AniEd other than what�s above,
but with what you know now, you can easily work the other things out and have <span
class=SpellE>alot</span> of fun doing it. Just keep in mind a few of the terms
defined below and you should have no problem, Enjoy!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Stroke</u>: a stroke is a single line that you�ve drawn</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Path</u>: a path is a stroke across time. It represents
the path that the strokes you have drawn will take as time progresses and the
stroke move, change colour, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=tabletpc><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The
Tablet PC<o:p></o:p></b></a></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:tabletpc'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>AniEd was
developed on a Tablet PC (which I kindly lent to by the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>Florida</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and Microsoft), and is
really meant for Tablets. While it is possible to draw using the mouse, and
some people do, many people (including myself) simply can�t stand it. What
little artistic skill I do have it practically thrown away by the mouse. The
Tablet is quite simply a superior input mechanism, and I believe that AniEd
only makes this even <span class=GramE>more clear</span> than it already was.
Just try drawing a few frames and animating them using a Tablet, and then try
with a mouse (or be like one of my crazy friends and try it with a touchpad)
you will no doubt be convinced as to which is easier to use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>What we
must realize is that the Tablet PC makes for us a new metaphor for input purely
based on <span class=GramE>it�s</span> ease. As we see in AniEd, the ability to
quickly and easily create drawings is a tool we must not ignore. In the future,
more applications will lean more toward dynamic content creation, rather than
content manipulation. Consider that most animation systems such as those used
for modern cartoons and computer games are based on an initial model being made
and then doll style rotated and shifted into the goal position. With the Tablet
PC we begin to see an environment when it is easier to make original drawings
rather than mutate and manhandle previously existing ones. This I believe will
be a major step forward in the evolution of time based user interactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Technical Stuff<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>This
section and below are intended to give a technical overview of AniEd, and are
by no means necessary for the average person to use AniEd. <span class=GramE>It�s</span>
intended audience are developers interested in AniEd, animation, Microsoft Ink,
user interfaces, .Net, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>First of
all, AniEd is designed to compliment and extend the Ink API, not to replace it.
Internally, the architecture of AniEd is similar to the Ink API, and tries to
use it whenever possible. With this I hope to gain from all the time and effort
put into the Ink API, automatic integration into future advancements of the API,
and also to make integration into future and existing applications as easy as
possible. In a time when more and more APIs and standards are coming out, the
last thing a developer needs is another one, in this way I hope you will see
that the AniEd can be easily introduced into most applications, with little
additional work, and you still keep and use all of your Ink based utilities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>AniEd <span
class=GramE>itself</span> is written entirely in C#, using Visual Studio .Net.
This means that it is easy to compile down to a library and include in any .Net
application. It does however require the <span class=SpellE>Microsoft.Ink</span>
library which is on most, but not all .Net enabled PCs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=howitworks><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>How
it works<o:p></o:p></b></a></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:howitworks'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>At <span
class=GramE>it�s</span> core the animation process is executed by interpolating
between �key frame� strokes. The main difference between the standard Ink
architecture and AniEd is obviously that standard Ink doesn�t contain any time
based information. This along with numerous other differences make using
standard Strokes a non-ideal choice for <span class=GramE>a</span> animation.
This is not to take anything away from the Ink API which I believe is a superb
piece of work and does <span class=GramE>it�s</span> job amazingly well, it
just simply wasn�t designed to do animations. One of the main issues is the
public accessibility of the data which make up each stroke without having to go
through an intermediary like <span class=SpellE>GetPoints</span>. This allows
for vastly improved look up speed which is exactly what is necessary for the
interpolation used in animation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span>There
are also a large number of other design changes, mostly based around the fact
that standard Ink objects aren�t meant to be animated. However, repetition of
code is avoided as much as possible, and where ever it was possible I exposed
Ink conversion tools, and implemented features such as rendering and selection
using modified version of the standard Ink API. The rendering is broken into a
high performance renderer for animation playback, and a high quality renderer
for normal viewing/editing (for the high performance renderer, the quality is <span
class=GramE>adjustable,</span> to give fine tuned control to the editing
application). I use linear interpolation (i.e. only C0 continuity) because I
found that it is more intuitive, and brings the giant goal of �pick up and use�
much closer. C1 continuity of animation would have looked good in some cases,
but would have made it a little more complicated to perform quick prototyping
type work AniEd was designed for. Almost all of the system was designed for
ease of use, from automatic selection of the next stroke to be drawn, to lasso
selection, to an easy to understand animation metaphor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Before
Strokes are entered into AniEd, they are lengthwise <span class=SpellE>resampled</span>
or <span class=SpellE>reparameterized</span>. This solves a major problem when
using the Tablet PC pen for input, which generally creates a line with a large
cluster of points all at one point along the line (i.e. whenever the user
slowed down just a bit). This would make point based interpolation a nightmare
and would cause it to cost way too much CPU time. My solution is to essentially
move the control points around a little bit so that each point is an equal
distance away from <span class=GramE>it�s</span> two neighbors. While this
causes a slight loss of quality in certain areas it is vastly made up by the
time and quality of the resulting animations. Also due to the large amount of
samplings from the pen, my early experimentation shows the loss of quality to
be almost unnoticeable. Consider the diagram below:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notice now how the middle line is sort of bunch up onto the
left side of the line, this is due entirely <span class=GramE>to</span> uneven
control point spacing, which is removed by the AniEd system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=keyfeatures><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Some
Key Features<o:p></o:p></b></a></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:keyfeatures'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span><u>Random
access playback</u> � Unlike certain over animation systems, AniEd can jump
between rendering different times easily without really even noticing. This
allows for features like backwards playing, slow-motion, fast replay all
without almost any additional effort. The AniEd Control even includes a <span
class=SpellE>RateOfTime</span> property which can be set to any positive or
negative number to adjust how the animation is viewed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span><u>Interpolation
Architecture</u> � The interpolation subsystem used by AniEd is available to
your application as well, which gives you utilities like interpolating betweens
colors, <span class=SpellE>ints</span>, floats and such, and more advanced
tools such as interpolating between point based lines, <span class=SpellE>resampling</span>
an array to a different length, floating point indexing (from 0.0 to 1.0
instead of integer based), and length wise <span class=SpellE>resampling</span>
of point based lines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span><u>Stores
pressure information</u> � only available on the Tablet PC of course, the AniEd
architecture is designed to store, interpolate, etc. pen normal pressure
information along with the points and other information making up a Stroke.
While the current Ink API doesn�t allow new Strokes to be created with user defined
packet information (including pressure), the AniEd architecture is silently
keeping all this information so that when hopefully newer versions of the API
are released the changes which need to <span class=GramE>made</span> to AniEd
should take no time at all. Also, all previous animation files, which had
pressure information, will finally be able to use it. Most of the Ink developer
<span class=GramE>community (including myself) are</span> waiting patiently for
this addition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span><u>Cut and
Paste</u> operations, using the clipboard are integrated into AniEd, so that
any single frame or collection of strokes can be copied out of an animation and
pasted into a document. Or ink object from other applications can be pasted as
into AniEd, and then managed like any other Ink. The majority of cut and paste
operations are based around the default Ink cut and paste methods, and thus
will automatically update themselves as new versions and new formats arise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span><u>Serialization</u>
is fully supported in that the <span class=SpellE>InkPath</span> object is
serializable, and also exposed a custom set of save/load functions which offer
a slight performance boost over the serialization method, and write into
standard <span class=SpellE>StreamWriter</span> and <span class=SpellE>StreamReader</span>
objects so that they can be made a part of a large file format. They also use a
text based format, which compressed very well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span><u>Low-memory
usage</u>: It uses a more direct access to information philosophy than the
Microsoft Ink classes, for instance giving direct access to point buffers rather
than first copying it into an intermediary buffer and then giving it to the
requester. One of the distinct advantages here is that the dynamic memory usage
during real-time playback is very minimal, and on the whole not a lot of memory
is wasted or unnecessarily created and destroyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>You can also
use AniEd as an <u>Ink collector</u> (by just never adjusting the time) and
benefit from features like lasso selection, dragging, copy/paste, save/load,
etc, which while they may not be too much of a hassle to code, are nice to have
wrapped into one neat little bundle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=examplesof><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>AniEd
Shows Examples Of</b></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>For anyone
looking for examples on how to use many of the features in .Net and the Ink
API, I think you�ll find AniEd a good source. I know a few of the other
projects I�ve been working on included me copy and pasting a lot of code from
AniEd. Any, for those interested, here is a short list of some of the more
important operations which you can find somewhere or other in AniEd:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Double
buffering, continuous updating, Ink collection, dynamic Ink rendering, rendering
using Ink, serialization, saving/loading Ink, Ink events, lasso selection, hit
testing, Ink manipulation and interpolation, working with multiple Ink objects,
copy and pasting Ink, animation playing/editing, Stroke packet management (in
Strokes and in the <span class=SpellE>NewPackets</span> event), dragging Ink,
and of course a whole bunch of other little things.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=aniedinapps><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Using
AniEd in Your Application<o:p></o:p></b></a></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:aniedinapps'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>The
simplest way to do <span class=GramE>this,</span> is to include the AniEd
control into your application as you would any other Control.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span>Once you�ve done this, you�ll notice a few
key functions. First of all the �Ink� property returns to you a standard
Microsoft Ink object which you can use as you would any normal Ink. Also, the <span
class=SpellE>UseEditor</span> property can be used to turning the editing mode
on and off. But most importantly is probably the <span class=GramE>Play(</span>)
and Pause() functions, which do exactly as one would expect. A smart move would
also be to make sure you adjust the <span class=SpellE>RateOfTime</span>
variable before playing, the default value of 1.0 means normal playback. Other
than those basics, you will find that using AniEd is a very <span class=GramE>hands</span>
off process, as it does most of the work for you. In fact, if you simply turn
the editor on (<span class=SpellE>UseEditor</span>=true) and then never adjust
the Time variable or hit <span class=GramE>Play(</span>), you can easily use
AniEd as a Ink collector with most of the work done for you already.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>There are
also a few events you can subscribe to, such as the time change event, which is
useful for say updating a text label as to the time in the animation, or moving
along a track-bar to match the time. And there is even a context menu event,
which is how AniEd tells you that you should bring up a context menu. If you
look at the source code for the example application, you see that most features
you would want to perform are only a few short method calls away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>If your
feeling a little more �hard core� and want to create your own animated Ink
control or other such app, you will find that your knowledge of the Ink API
will make moving to animated Ink very simple. The equivalent of a Stroke is a <span
class=SpellE>StrokePath</span>, which is a Stroke across time. The <span
class=SpellE>InkPath</span> is equivalent to an Ink object, except also across
time, and the <span class=SpellE>InkPathViewer</span> is semi-equivalent to the
Renderer object. The difference is that the <span class=SpellE>InkPathViewer</span>
includes a built in �selection� system where you can specify which strokes are
currently being selected. This is necessary as Strokes are destroyed and
recreated each frame, which makes keeping track of them a task which is more
easily handled by the renderer itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Also, each <span
class=SpellE>StrokePath</span> is made up of a collection of <span
class=SpellE>StrokeITs</span> (Strokes <span class=GramE>In</span> Time), which
are really the direct equivalent of Strokes, just with slightly looser access
privileges (for faster access), and some time based information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>You will
find the entire AniEd API fully and (fairly) clearly commented and explained.
Also be sure to check out the example editor, which shows you how easy it is to
integrate animated Ink into your application. Oh, by the way, just because the
AniEd example is non-resizable doesn�t mean that the AniEd control <span
class=GramE>is,</span> <span class=SpellE>infact</span> it doesn�t even notice
when it�s resized, as it doesn�t affect it much. I was just going for that wide-screen
movie editor look when creating the example app.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=sourcecode><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The
Source Code<o:p></o:p></b></a></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:sourcecode'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Included
with the AniEd package you will get the executable, a few examples <span
class=GramE>files,</span> and the source code for AniEd.exe. This is of course
just an example application of what can be done with AniEd, but it still quite
a decent app in and of itself. If you look in the source directory you will
find <span class=SpellE>AniInk.cs</span>, which contains the <span
class=SpellE>AniInk</span> (animated Ink) namespace and everything is all in
there, as a reference you can look at the example app and see how to use it. If
you have any questions, feel free to contact me at <a
href="mailto:lewey@ufl.edu">lewey@ufl.edu</a> . Of course I�m not liable for
any damages that you may incur caused by your usage of anything in this
package.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=thefuture><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Possible
Future Advancements</b></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>One thing
some people have asked for is sound effects, that would be cool, but it brings
in a lot of headaches that I simply didn�t have time to deal with right now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>A Shockwave
exporter would also be a nice addition, so that animations could be posted on
the net for anyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span><span
class=GramE>And of course flat out more editing tools!</span> Some of the most
expensive software available is animation editing tools, there is no way I
could complete with such people, the difference is just more coders creating
more tools over more time (and being paid to do it), I believe the architecture
I designed to be flexible enough to make the creation of such tools fairly easy,
if someone just invested the time into it.</p>
