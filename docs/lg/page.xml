	<header value="Support Lewey's World!" />
	<descrip value="The best reason to donate to Lewey’s World is just to show appreciation for one or more of the apps posted here. If you think something here is really cool, or if you spent a long time playing one of the games, or if for whatever reason you think it just deserves money, then I assure you any amount you give will be greatly appreciated! The other reason is to keep me from writing accounting software, as I reason below:" />

	<descrip value="This website is devoted to creating new and interesting applications which extend current ideas and technologies into something innovative, intuitive and imagenertaining (meaning \"with pretty pictures\"). There are games with new and experimental interfaces while there are some that are just plain cool; I’ve got innovative editors working on all sorts of different mediums; and a bunch of other stuff that is hard to classify but fun to look at." />

	<descrip value="All of this software is free and handed out to anyone who happens to be passing by, which I believe, is the best way to get these new ideas out into the world. New and interesting ideas are the cornerstone of progress and I hope that Lewey’s World has done its small part in broadening people’s minds on what can be done with what we have, which seeming boundaries can be broken, and possibly pointing out a few borders should probably not have been broken." />

	<descrip value="The only problem with this great plan is that I’ve got to actually do it, and considering I do everything on this site, that is a lot of work. Apart from being a full time student I’ve got to live my life, do research, stay in shape, find a girl, enjoy the college life, and somehow find money for the bills. That is where your donations come in: If I get a job, then I won’t be able to do much on this website and the flow of interesting apps will become a trickle. Thus any money you give goes towards me not having to get a job and spending the time I would have spent on that job creating new and interesting content for Lewey’s World. Essentially this is the fund to prevent me from having to write accounting software (you saw Office Space; you know what that does to people)." />

	<descrip value="Really this is an experiment. It is a test to see if I can support myself by doing my dream job of writing odd-ball apps. While I do enjoy working in an office on some big project (and have done so), the real joy of programming for me comes in realizing new ideas in code. So if you wish to help in my dream of expanding the knowledge of mankind, or if you are just a good person, then you will surely want to support Lewey’s World by making a donation and helping shape our world into a better place (or at least the same place but with better graphics)." />

	<descrip value="The PaperWork project has, I'm sad to say, been ended as it was realised that a real animation editor is not made with a few cool UI concepts but is founded on long and arduous hours of adding features and additional tools. Basically it is a job best suited for teams and preferably professional teams, and quite frankly there already are many such groups out there creating great animation systems. This project ended up just really been an experiment or prototype for a real application and which I simply don't have the time to finish. I must say however that in it's initial stage it showed great progress and I think was a good core for a more complete animation system." />
	<descrip value="To those who are interested, PaperWork was to be an extension of the concepts founded in Ink AniEd, which was to represent all animations through a series of easy drawn 'strokes' the strokes would express how the shapes moved and transformed over time. This amounts to a key-frame animation system with a simple interface which was quite intuitive. If you would like what source code there is I still have it but I doubt anyone will have a use for it" />
