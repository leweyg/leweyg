		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>ESL (pronounced like �easel�, the artists� platform) is a high level shading 
			language, with a graph based / object-oriented design intended to solve the 
			problems of large scale shader development. It combines a clean programming 
			language with a flexible graph structure to allow game programmers, artists and 
			engine developers to have more control over their shaders while focusing their 
			attention on what makes each particular material shine.
		</p>
		<P>Current generation shading languages lack the kind of internal structural 
			flexibility needed to create different versions, combinations and LODs of 
			materials based on a material graph outline. For this many game engines and 
			editors implement their own shader builder which takes their high level 
			material representations and wrangles it into HLSL using specialized code. ESL 
			replaces this complex proprietary system with a clean programmable compiler 
			style solution which lets the developers write classes in a simple 
			object-oriented shading language, the artists connect these objects in an 
			intuitive fashion (or easily export them from Maya/Max), and then the game 
			engine manages the compiler which translates these two into HLSL or another 
			directly usable shading language. The key is an object oriented shading 
			language with a clean high-level structure which easily compiles out so that 
			the resulting shader is just as efficient as if written directly in HLSL 
			without nice classes. In this way you get an extremely easy to create and 
			evolve shader builder with tons of compiler optimizations which would takes 
			ages to write into your own builder.
		</P>
		<h2>Language Doc</h2>
		<p><a href="ESL.doc">The language doc</a> gives both overviews and details on the 
			primary features included in ESL. This includes the design, implementation and 
			philosophy behind each item. Because the ESL language is more of an extension 
			to HLSL rather than a completely new language, the document only covers those 
			features which are not present in HLSL or C#.</p>
		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<p>Here are a few examples of what you can easily do&nbsp;in ESL. For more 
			examples, check out the <A href="examples.html">examples page</A>.</p>

					<p>This is roughly the simplest shader you can write in ESL, it just multiplies the 
						vertex position by the projection matrix and declares a float4 constant which 
						is passed out as the pixel color. Keep in mind that ESL's syntax was designed 
						as a hybrid between HLSL and C#.<A href="examples.html">Full description here</A>.</p>

					<p>ESL is a fundamentally graph based language, shown to the right&nbsp;is an 
						object graph which generates the shader seen above. This graph was created in 
						the&nbsp;ESL_Designer visual editor and impliments a refracted screen oriented 
						texture which fades into reflected reflected environment map for points which 
						reflect at a strong angle. This is somewhat similar to the water shader in 
						Half-Life 2. The point is that this complex effect could be quickly created 
						from a number of small and easy to impliment classes.

					<h3>
						<a href="ESL.zip">ESL.zip</a>
					</h3>
					<p>REQUIRES: <STRONG>.Net 1.1</STRONG>, <STRONG>DirectX 9.0c</STRONG>, and "<STRONG>DirectX 
							for Managed Code</STRONG>". If FxViewer crashes when you try to open it, it 
						probably means you don't have "DirectX for Managed Code". I've prepared a <A href="ManagedDX.zip">
							small installer for it</A>, just un-zip and run dxsetup.exe, assuming you 
						already have .Net 1.1 and DirectX 9.0c</p>
					<P>This download contains:</P>
					<P>ESL_Designer - An easy-to-use&nbsp;visual graph editor which uses the classes 
						defined in an ESL file to generate a valid material and then exports it as an 
						Fx shader (i.e. includes the ESL compiler). Most of the examples from the 
						examples page are also included&nbsp;and can be loaded up and edited in the 
						designer.</P>
					<P>FxViewer - An example DirectX application which reads the Fx shader outputted by 
						ESL_Designer and renders an object with that shader. It is an only very 
						slightly modified DirectX SDK sample, intended to show that ESL can be used 
						'under-the-hood' very easily.</P>
					<P>Also includes: <a href="ESL.doc">ESL.doc</a>, System.esl and <a href="myshader.html">
							MyShader.esl</a>
					</P>
					<P>PLEASE feel free to modify the classes in MyShader.esl by adding new ones or 
						modifying the ones in there. Any changes you make to this file will show up in 
						the designer and command line compiler. The internal compiler includes pretty 
						good syntax and compiler errors (with name, line and column) and so you 
						shouldn't have a hard time writing new code.</P>
					<P>NOTE: This package does contain some of the example media from the DirectX SDK. 
						Because this is not a publicly exposed webpage yet, I think that is okay for 
						now.</P>
