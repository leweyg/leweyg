<div id="content"><font size=3><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><h1>Freed Invasion</h1><p>Freed Invasion is a simple and fun puzzle game which quickly leads to interesting strategy. Based on the classic 'Color Invasion' game which is played on a normal 2D board, Freed Invasion as been 'freed' of it's 2 dimentional confinement so that you can play it on numerous 3d boards, or on normal flat boards with different shapes and patterns. The object of the game is to occupy more cells than your opponent. Two players alternate turns where you may change the color of all your occupied cells to some other colour, which makes any neighboring cells of the same colour become yours as well (a fairly decent AI is included for single player mode). It's really very simple once you try it out.</p><p>Freed Invasion is part of <a href="freed.html">The Freed Series</a> of games 'freed' from their two dimensional confinement.</p><center><center><table ><tr><td ><center><a href="screens/FreedInv_0.jpeg"><img src="screens/FreedInv_0_small.jpeg"></a><br>Mobius Strip<br></center></td><td ><center><a href="screens/FreedInv_1.jpeg"><img src="screens/FreedInv_1_small.jpeg"></a><br>Sphere<br></center></td></tr><tr><td ><center><a href="screens/FreedInv_7.jpeg"><img src="screens/FreedInv_7_small.jpeg"></a><br>Two interconnected planes with<br>3 neighbors on each plane<br></center></td><td ><center><a href="screens/FreedInv_3.jpeg"><img src="screens/FreedInv_3_small.jpeg"></a><br>A cube of cells<br>Each has 6 neighbors<br></center></td></tr><tr><td ></td></tr></table></center><a href="#screens"><h3>More Screen Shots...</h3></a><br><br></center><a name="about"><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0" ><tr><td><h1>About</h1><p>Freed Invasion was written by me (Lewey Geselowitz) and turned out to be a pretty fun little puzzle game. Originally I was working on <a href="freedgo.html">Freed Go</a> and while doing so I figured it would be pretty easy to modify that program to become a Color Invasion type app, and it seems to have worked. It is also a part of <a href="freed.html">The Freed Series</a> which is a collection of standard 2D games expanded into the 3rd dimension and beyond. As far as the technology goes, it is based on my <a href="index.html">Lewcid interaction system</a>.</p><p>If you have ideas for new board types, adjusts to these ones, or just want to leave a comment I'm always more than happy to hear from people who have tried out my software. Feel free to drop me a line at <a href="mailto:lewey@lewcid.com">lewey@lewcid.com</a></p></td></tr></table><br></a><a name="download"><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0" ><tr><td><h1>Download</h1><p>Freed Invasion is available for both Windows and Mac OS X. Download the .zip file, unzip and run. For Windows make sure that the included glut32.dll file is in the same directory as FreedGo.exe OR you have installed GLUT on your system. For Mac OS X make sure that GLUT is already installed. Also the Mac version is Carbon based so while I havn't tested it, it may run earlier Mac OSes.</p><p>If you appreciate this application, a small <a href="../../lg/donate.html">donation</a> to support me writing more interesting apps like it (and not get a job writing accounting software) would be greatly appreciated.</p><table bgcolor="#f0c0c0"><tr><td><center><a href="FreedInvasion.zip"><font size=5><i>FreedInvasion.zip</i></font></a></center><br><b>Platform: </b> Windows<br><b>Usage: </b> Download, unzip, and run<br></td></tr></table><br><table bgcolor="#f0c0c0"><tr><td><center><a href="FreedInvasionMac.zip"><font size=5><i>FreedInvasionMac.zip</i></font></a></center><br><b>Platform: </b> Mac OS X<br><b>Usage: </b> Download, unzip and run<br><b>Note:</b> I'm new to Carbon programming,<br>so the controls are not displayed.<br>Use this site as a reference.<br></td></tr></table><br></td></tr></table><br></a><a name="controls"><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0" ><tr><td><h1>Controls</h1><p>The controls are a little 'rustic' but they do the job and are very simple to understand and get going with.
