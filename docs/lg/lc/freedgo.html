That is the purpose of Freed Go, it lets you play Go on a Sphere, a Torus, a Mobius Strip or on numerous flat fields but with 3, 5 or 6 neighbors (there are 11 different <a href="#boards">board types</a> in all)! Essentially this is an experiment in how the basic rules of Go can be applied to different networks of stone locations, but is also an interesting test to see if you really understand Go techniques. Remember that all your techniques should work here, except that they will be manifested in a different form. You can also experiment and <a href="#custom">create your own boards</a> or play a <a href="#remote">network game</a> against a friend. Please note that Freed Go is not just a 3d graph of black and white nodes you could play Go on, it is a <b>complete Go application</b> with all the rules and features you need to play a real game (undo, dead stone removal, KO checking, territory counting, etc).</p><p>If you are new to the game of Go, I found the <a href="http://playgo.to/interactive/">Interactive Way to Go</a> to be an excellent site on how to play the game. Of course it only teaches the 2D version, but the rules are the same.</p><center><p>Freed Go is part of <a href="freed.html">The Freed Series</a> of games 'freed' from their two dimensional confinement. It has also been featured on the front page of <a href="http://gobase.org/">GoBase.org</a> and <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/games/04/06/19/174256.shtml?tid=127&tid=186&tid=208">SlashDot Games</a>.</p><p>On this page: <a href="#about">About</a>, <a href="#download">Download</a>, <a href="#custom">Custom Boards</a>, <a href="#off">3D Model To Go Board Converter</a>, <a href="#remote">Remote Games</a>, <a href="#related">Related Sites</a>, <a href="#controls">Controls</a>, <a href="#boards">Board Types</a>, <a href="#screens">Screenshots</a>.</p></center>

To anyone who has put some serious thought into Go I'm sure this will act as a refreshing twist and help broaden your understanding of this amazing game. It is also a part of <a href="freed.html">The Freed Series</a> which is a collection of standard 2D games expanded into the 3rd dimension and beyond. As far as the technology goes, it is based on my <a href="index.html">Lewcid interaction system</a>.</p><p>If you have ideas for new board types, adjusts to these ones, or just want to leave a comment I'm always more than happy to hear from people who have tried out my software. Feel free to drop me a line at <a href="mailto:lewey@lewcid.com">lewey@lewcid.com</a></p></td></tr></table><br></a><a name="download"><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0" ><tr><td><h1>Download</h1><p>Freed Go is available for both Windows and Mac OS X. Download the .zip file, unzip and run. For Windows make sure that included glut32.dll file is in the same directory as FreedGo.exe OR you have installed GLUT on your system. For Mac OS X make sure that GLUT is already installed. Also the Mac version is Carbon based so while I havn't tested it, it may run earlier Mac OSes.</p><p>If you appreciate this application, a small <a href="../../lg/donate.html">donation</a> to support me writing more interesting apps like it (and not get a job writing accounting software) would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I have not updated the Mac version to 1.1, because it would require a fair amount of work on my part and I'm not sure anyone would actually use it.

The boards you create are fully intergrated into the application and you can even play them across a network (if both players have the file). Just follow the format below, and then drop the file over FreedGo.exe to play on it!</p><center><table ><tr><td ><p>Here is an <a href="pyramid.txt">example file</a>, and below is a short commented fragment from the example file.<br><br>

</p></td><td ><center><a href="pyramid.txt"><img src="screens/FreedGo_Pyr_small.jpeg"></a><br></center></td></tr></table></center><p>This is all pretty self-explanitory: first the number of nodes; then the node 'scale' which is the radius of each stone. Then for each stone, you give how many neighbors it has, and then those neighbors (use 0-based indices, and the order you specify them in the file is their index). And finally for each node give a location in 3d space. Keep these locations roughly within -1 to 1 in all dimensions. Regarding the neighbors, in the example each node meantions all of it's neighbors, but you actually only have to say that one is the neighbor of another and it automatically goes the other way as well.</p><p>Have fun creating new boards, and give me a <a href="mailto:lewey@lewcid.com">yell</a> if you have any questions or if you make any cools boards. Possibly I'll setup a gallery of interesting boards if people send them in.</p></td></tr></table><br></a><a name="off"><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0" ><tr><td><h1>3D Model To Go Board Converter</h1><p>With Freed Go you can play Go over any 3D graph, which I realised look alot like wireframe 3d meshes! So I wrote this little tool which converts an .OFF model into a Freed Go board. Just drop any .off file over OFF2FreedGo.exe and it generates a Go board you can play on (send the board to your buddy and you can play over the net). If you run it from the Command Prompt you can also specify more arguements on how you want the board generated, or of course you can edit it once it's generated (the board <a href="#custom">format</a> is very simple). Enjoy.</p><p>To find out about the OFF file format: <a href="http://www2.csit.fsu.edu/~burkardt/data/off/off.html">here</a> is a pretty good desciption (with some basic examples).

Unfortunatly I don't have a server so you'll have to meet other people yourself (I've heard it's not that hard). Once you've found a buddy setting it up is very easy. There is no buildt in chat so I'm assuming you are communicating with your friend over some chat program or another (AIM, MSN, etc.).<br>
<b>1)</b> Both of you download Freed Go and fire her up. Hit 'R' to start a remote game<br>
<b>2)</b> One of you hit 'Yes' to host a game, then give your IP to your buddy<br>
<b>3)</b> The other should hit 'No' to connect to a host; enter the IP your buddy gives you; and hit 'Connect'<br>
<b>4)</b> Enjoy your game!</p><p>Once you have connected it's all pretty simple, no big surpises. If you want to play on a custom board make sure both people have the file on their computers and in the same directories as the binaries. Then drop the file over the app to open up that board and connect, the rest is all the same as normal.</p></td></tr></table><br></a><a name="related"><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0" ><tr><td><h1>Related Sites</h1><p>This is a short collection of other sites relating to extending Go in new and interesting ways:</p><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~lukeb/3dgo/3dgo.html">3D Battle Go</a> - An amazingly fun and fast paced Go based puzzle game.<br><br><a href="http://xistrat.sourceforge.net/index2.html">XiStrat</a> - Very interesting heavy math approach to 3d Go (and related turn based games)<br><br><a href="http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/boards.htm">Alternate Go Boards</a> - Some really great information and pictures of alternate Go boards (all are either already in Freed Go or you can easily add them)<br><br><a href="http://www.nrinstruments.demon.co.uk/diamond/diamintro.html">Henry Segerman's Diamond Go</a> - Buy an actual diamond (shaped) Go board<br><br><a href="http://plaza.ufl.edu/lavigne/ufgoclub/">UF Go Club</a> - The University of Florida Go club<br><br></td></tr></table><br></a><a name="controls"><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0" ><tr><td><h1>Controls</h1><p>Freed Go was designed for experimentation, so the controls are a little 'rustic' but they do the job and are very simple to understand and get going with.

'Empty' areas are marked with small brown stones, and connected stones are marked with a white line. You can change the board you are playing on by typing the key which corresponds to that board. See the different board-keys below.</p><p>Listed here are the instructions on how to use Freed Go. When you run the game you will see them in a small window behind the main game window.</p><p><pre>The small brown stones represent emtpy locations.
Left click on a brown stone to play at that location.
Drag the right mouse button to change your view.
Press 'N' for a new game.
Press 'P' for pass.
Press 'U' to Undo previous moves.
Press 'R' to start a Remote game.
Hold down SHIFT and then left click to remove dead stones.
Press 'Q' to count occupied areas and show score.

Also some of them are just impossible (like the all-white ones) but where made that way to better express the shape of the board.
