<h1>LIS: Original Lewcid Interaction System</h1>



<p>This is a set of common code which I've used in a few of my 3d games and applications. I figured it was about time I stopped rewriting every thing each time I wrote a new program and started my own sort of graphics libary. You will find programs written using Lewcid below.</p><p>The 'Lewcid Interaction System' as I call it (because it is unworthy of the name 'graphics engine') is designed so that I can easily prototype different ideas in 3d interaction. To this end it manages most of the object composition, animation, hit testing, garbage collection, and the like so that I can focus on the important part, the app itself. Also it is based on OpenGL for it's amazing flexibility and portability (but mostly because I just love the OpenGL API). While focused on flexibility rather than performance, it has been designed so that it runs at a pretty decent speed. Below are a few examples of applications which use Lewcid. </p><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0"><tr><td><h3><a href="shuzzle.html">Shuzzle - The Shadow Puzzle</a></h3>A 3D block building puzzle where you cannot see the blocks but only their shadows. This means you'll have to keep a strong mental understanding of the blocks and how they fit together. A great brain buster. Also it's one of the few games that has stencil shadows for a reason than just looking cool.</td><td><a href="shuzzle.html"><img src="screens/Shuzzle_7_small.jpeg"></a></td></tr></table><br><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0"><tr><td><h3><a href="freedgo.html">Freed Go</a></h3>Lets you play the game of Go on many different boards including a Sphere, a Torus, a Mobius Strip or on numerous flat fields but with 3, 5 or 6 neighbors. This is a very fun and interesting twist to the standard game of Go and should keep you entertained for a long time.</td><td><a href="freedgo.html"><img src="screens/FreedGo_9_small.jpeg"></a></td></tr></table><br><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0"><tr><td><h3><a href="freedinvasion.html">Freed Invasion</a></h3>Extends the classic puzzle game 'Color Invasion' into the world of 3d with all the interesting boards found in Freed Go. Essentially it's a fun puzzle game which draws you in and soon has you hooked.</td><td><a href="freedinvasion.html"><img src="screens/FreedInv_1_small.jpeg"></a></td></tr></table><br></td></tr></table></font>
