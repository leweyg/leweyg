<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Requirements:</span></b></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I�ve had this program tested on a 600 Mhz machine with a TNT2, and it ran fine.

If you have any better than that, it should run perfectly. If the MFC version

gives you trouble, the GLUT version may run slower but will probably work. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Using It:</span></b></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Once you have the program running, hold down the right mouse button and drag to

rotate the object. Pressing and dragging the left mouse button uses the current

�saber�. The default saber is a cutter which lets you slice into and

automatically chop off pieces of your block. The buttons on the side lets you

select which saber you want to use, each is designed to work as someone who has

used programs like MS Paint would expect it to. And that�s most of it. There

are also more advanced features in the menus. The best way to learn VSaber is

to use it, it has been designed to be as intuitive as possible. Please remember

however this is merely a demo.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Following is a description of the tool, but to use

it all you really need is what�s above.</span></b></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Introduction:</span></b></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Most modern 3d modeling systems have the user interact with the system by

moving around control points which are then viewed as polygons or curved

surfaces. These systems however are very non-intuitive, that is you cannot

simply guess how to use it, you must be told in some form or another. This

makes them hard to use, and not appropriate for general usage. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

VSaber is a modeling tool which aims to be highly intuitive. It does this by

simulating some object, which you can then carve into whatever shape you like,

by using a mouse or stylus to select where and at what angle you which to carve

(the mouse of course cannot have different angles and only cut straight through

the object). This allows the user to interact with the model as if they were

dealing with a real carve able object (a block of wood or marble for example).

Because it is obvious how one carves such an object, the user needs no further

training on how to use the program. The matter of rotation is handled simply by

holding down the right mouse button while moving the mouse, this allows you to

change the angle of the model.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

VSaber represents all data as �voxels� or �volume elements�, which is

essentially like a three dimensional bitmap. This allows for a simple format

which most people can understand (as opposed to high order curved surfaces),

and also for a possible future format which can be generally accepted than any

single triangle or surface format.&nbsp; It also allows it to be easily added

into with such features as converting triangles to voxels and such. More on

this later.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Additional Features:</span></b></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

VSaber is not merely a carving tool, the ability to interact with a model in

this easy to use form allows for a few other equally intuitive features:</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>-</span><span style='font-size:7.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Coloring the model is as easy as coloring

a real model, simply select the color of paint you wish to use, and click or

drag the left mouse button over the object to paint it. Paint will

automatically adjust itself for the depth of the model at that point, so

colours and lines will wrap over the object, just as if you�d use a real paint

brush. In this way, coloring the model becomes as easy as using 2d painting

tools such as MS Paint.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>-</span><span style='font-size:7.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Drawing 3d structures also becomes very

easy, simply reverse the process so that instead of cutting away from an

object, you are filling in points in space. This allows you to easily �draw� 3d

objects in almost the same way you would draw a 2d diagram.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>File Format:</span></b></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Currently VSaber uses it�s own �.vsb� format, which is a compressed format

which contains information regarding both colour and fill data for each voxel.

Because there are often strips of like data in voxel diagrams, it uses a very

simple run length compressor, which gives very good results. Internally there

is also the ability to generate voxel data from certain triangle based formats,

and even certain MRI formats, but these have not been exposed to the interface.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Tablet PC:</span></b></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I actually got the idea for VSaber while hearing about the capabilities of the

Tablet PC. Primarily that the stylus gave information regarding what angle it

was being held at. It occurred to me that with that ability, you could create a

virtual carving system which was far more intuitive and nature than anything

involving a mouse. It would allow you to make curved cuts without having to

change your camera view or use some strange curved surface interface, you

simply angle the stylus differently. Using the Tablet PC, the VSaber interface

becomes as easy to use as drawing diagrams on a piece of paper, however they

are in full 3d. It has been the goal of multitudes of interactive programs to

make 3d modeling as similar to 2d diagrams as possible, this I believe is the

closest it can possibly come. If you have an object of a certain shape, merely

draw it�s outline in the program and there you have it. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is in this way that the Tablet PC not only gives you the control of an

actual pen rather than a crude mouse, but also the angular information of a

carving tool. The total package of Tablet PC and VSaber make a perfect pair for

3d model editing, and will I�m sure be a must for any design studio.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The current release of VSaber doesn�t take advantage of Microsoft�s Rich Ink

API which gives you information regarding the stylus, to use this API I would

need a Tablet PC to develop on. Also, the current rendering engine for VSaber

is not optimized for certain Tablet PCs and may reduce the frame rate, this

also is hard to get around without an actual system for testing.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Current Implimentation:</span></b></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The current implementation is written in C++ (using Visual C++ 6.0). The core

is pure C++ (which can be generalized to OpenGL or DirectX), then there is an

OpenGL rendering and interaction layer (OpenGL because I thought it would be

easier to perform certain point based rendering techniques), and then I wrote a

GLUT and an MFC user interface so you could compile for any platform, but the

MFC version is a lot easier to use with all the options in menus and buttons

and such (the GLUT version requires you referring to a chart of key mappings).</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Development:</span></b></p>
