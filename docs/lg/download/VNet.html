VNet is currently unavialable and will probably be scraped all together, however if your interested in the project, I would gladly either pass it on to you or restart it myself. So unless I hear from anyone, VNet will die with all the other "hey that sounds cool" programming ideas. Personally I feel the concept is sound and could really go somewhere, but I've been doing so much other stuff I havn't really got down to just redoing it and making it what is should be.
