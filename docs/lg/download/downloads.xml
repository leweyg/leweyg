Essentially it just adds the following commands so that when you type them forgetting that your not in UNIX anymore you won't get an error: <b>ls, cat, clear, cp, mv, mkdir, pico (opens Notepad), rm and rmdir</b>. Not too much, but enough to make the transition managable. " />

In the Edit System Variable dialog box, move the cursor to the end of the string in the Variable Value field and type a semicolon (;) followed by the full directory name I told you to copy or write down.

	<update date="9/26/2003" value="After a couple hours making cool implicit equations (is it wrong to enjoy that?), I decided to add a few of the more interesting ones to the 'Equations' menu (these are a set of example equations), as well as fix a small math bug, give it a cool icon, and add a feature that lets you see 'inside' the volume instead of just it's surface (called 'View Inside Volume' in the 'View' menu). Oh and I reduced the default resolution down to 60^3 (change it in the 'Quality' menu). Enjoy." />
	<descrip value="<b>Note:</b> ImpView also includes a small symbolic equation evaluator. For stuff like 'sqrt(cos(pi^2))' or something. It's called 'Calc' under the 'Imp View' menu" />
	</subblock>
	<subblock title="About">
	<descrip value="<b>Math Stuff:</b> The system graphs the implicit equation by sampling it at discrete values in the given domain, if the function is true at that coordinate, it puts a point there (technically it puts a point if the result of the equation is non zero). However, don't try anything too fancy, I have only implimented the basic math operations (+ - * / ^ sin cos tan asin acos atan ln > >= < <= etc.). Also The reason I have you only enter equations with > >= < or <= in them is that if you used the equals sign, the result of the implicit equation would be a surface. And surfaces don't appear very well (or at all) when you discretely sample the surface like this system does." />
	<descrip value="<b>Tech Stuff:</b> I wrote this program in about 5 hours! Well sort of. Actually all I did was tie together a few parts from some of my other projects, and added a few extras like a fast evaluation core, interface, etc. First of all it uses the voxel engine I'm working on for the upcoming version of <a href=\"http://www.leweyg.com/vsaber/index.html\">VSaber</a> (only demo available right now). This engine is actually a full fledge volumetric carving system, here I just disabled a few of the editing features and used it as a visualizer. The rendering core of this engine is a high-performance software based algorithum, because it's targeted for Tablet PCs which don't have great graphics cards (which you need if your rendering 80^3 voxels like VSaber does. NOTE: 80^3 voxels is the default quality setting for Imp View). The expression parsing and scripting core come from <a href=\"http://www.leweyg.com/download/Crystal.html\">Crystal Math</a>, this let me convert a written equation into a set of steps which you could follow to evaluate that expression. I then wrote a high performance evaluator which let me very quickly see if the given equation is true at a certain (x,y,z) coordinate (and by true I mean non-zero, the < and > operators simply return 1 for true and 0 for false). Then simply bring the two together and voila!, you have can visualize a 3D implicit equation as a voxelized volume! Now I'm sure a few of you are thinking you could get better performance for volumetric rendering, this is very true. However those super fast rendering algorithms only work for static volumes, which makes them unsuitable for an interactive applications like VSaber. VSaber's engine is one of the few that uses a dynamic rendering system so that the volume can change from frame to frame. Why do I use it in this program then when the volume doesn't change that often? Because I didn't feel like writing another one when this one was just lying around!" />
	<descrip value="<b>Development:</b> Imp View is a 'multi-lingual' application, but not in the usual sense. The voxel engine, and rendering core are written in C++ bordering on straight C. The scripting stuff was in C++. All of this was wrapped and made into a .Net Windows Control using Managed C++. The interface (buttons, text areas, etc.) were written in C#, using a DLL containing the Managed C++ voxel Control." />

It also allows you have to spaces in the file names and even have the programs in different folders (as long as LewCheck and the input files are in the same folder). Also it creates a file called quickcompare.bat which remembers the last two programs you compared and can automatically recompare them by just double-clicking it, without you having to reenter their names. It also includes a 'Safe Check' feature, which helps stop the problem where a program will hang on a certain input and fill-up your harddrive (it does this by first running both programs without saving their output to a file, this way if one of them hangs, it never writes anything to file, saving you from creating 30 MB files filled with errors)." />
	<descrip value="NOTE: that <b>the differences found by LewCheck should be exactly the same as those found by Visual Check Pro</b>, because they both use the same underlying Windows tool ('fc'). This program is what I used instead of Visual Check Pro while taking CGS 2425, which allowed me to write my code in Visual C++, in any folder I want. I've also posted the source code if anyone is interested, as you'll see it was a VERY easy program to write. It requires Visual C++ 6.0 to compile." />

	<descrip value="Alarm Clock is a very simple yet extremely useful little application, although it no why does anything complicated, it has come in handy for my use many times (which is why it’s here, so I can download it). Essentially all it does is you give it a time at which to go off (either a certain time or a time from when you set the alarm) and at that time the alarm goes off. The sound it makes is a sound like a T-Rex roaring when the alarm goes off, so I’m sure it can wake most people. There is also an option for it to keep roaring until you hit enter, space or whatever (this is useful if you easily sleep-in like I do). It also has a feature to execute another program with command line options when the alarm goes off, and also a stop watch which can be useful." />

<descrip value="<b>The Ultimate 3D Puzzle Game Now for PC!</b><br>Evil Dice is an amazing puzzle game similar to <a href=\"http://psx.ign.com/articles/153/153896p1.html\">Devil Dice</a> for the PlayStation (which was considered by many major game critics to be quite possibly the greatest puzzle game ever, even eclipsing Tetris). It has a few simple rules: try and match up similar dice by rolling and pushing them around, scoring points as you do. Although this may seem simple, it leads to intense mind-busting lightning fast puzzle action like you've never experienced before. It is a great game which I have you doubt you will quickly become addicted to. <a href=\"#howtoplay\">How To Play</a>." />

<descrip value="The object of the game is to score as many points as you can in a 3 minute time-span. You do this by matching up die with the same number on top. The number of die you have to match up is equal to the number of the top of the die (so you have to match up 4 fours, 5 fives and so forth) (ones will be covered later). This matching is done by moving your character around on top of the die, if he is on top of a die, he will roll it in whatever direction you tell him, or move onto whatever die is there. If the die that your on sinks, you'll end up on the ground, where you can push die around (it's usually best to try to climb back onto a die that is rising if your stuck on the floor).

	<descrip value="Crystal Math is a powerful math app, that is still in the process of being developed. Not to say that it doesn't already contain many really cool features such as is. Basically you can use it for most simple math problems where it's nicer to write an equation than type out individual commands (so you type \"4*(3+5)\" instead of using the standard calculator and typeing [3] [+] [5] [*] [4]), plus if your using the Win32 interface you can click work it exactly like a normal calculator or like a symbolic one. It also comes in two formats, a Win32 dialog based program (which I use a lot) and a standard C++ console app, so it could be compiled for any 32 bit platform (I've included the Windows console version). For more information check out the guide. Also note that Crystal Math is the big brother of Grapher, which is no longer being developed, but contains many of the features that Crystal Math will eventually hold (although Crystal Math's versions will be more powerful when the times comes)" />

Basically, you select a bunch of .bmp files, drop them over QuickConvert, and it will not only make jpeg versions of them, but also scale them down (to a size you specify) and save the small .jpegs as a different file. For instance you drop MyPic.bmp over QuickConvert, and it will produce MyPic.jpeg and MyPic_small.jpeg. To adjust the settings and such which it uses to convert stuff, simply run the program without dropping a file onto it. Change your settings and close, the settings will automatically be saved." />

<page output="download/quickcapture.html" title="Quick Capture">
	<header value="Quick Capture" />
	<descrip value="Quite often I found myself to be taking screen captures (from Journal, or one of my apps or whatnot), copying them to Paint, cropping out the part I wanted and then either pasting that part to a document or saving it to a file. This process is tedious and irritating. So I wrote this quick little app to make the whole process much easier. This is how I use it:" />
	<descrip value="Most of the time I draw something up in Journal (but you could use almost any Windows app), and then hit Print-Screen (PrtSc on the keyboard), this copies the window to the clip board. Then run QuickCapture and whatever is in the clipboard will automatically be loaded and displayed. At this point you can optionally draw a rectangle around the part that you're interested in (simply click on one corner and drag to another). Then either hit the 'Copy' button to copy this image into the clip-board, or the 'Save' button to save it to file. And thats about it. Enjoy." />
	<descrip value="Some of the more advanced features: One of my favorites is if your creating a collection of images (say a series of screen shots), if you hit the 'Save' button and the file save slot is empty it will ask you where to save the file to, if it's not empty it will save it to the file specified. By hitting the 'Next' button, a quick little algorithum will search for the last number present in the file name you gave, and incriment it by 1. So if the last file you saved to was 'MyPicture08.bmp' it will change it to 'MyPicture09.bmp' and so forth. Really handy! Also note that it will save to either bmp or jpeg depending on the extension of the file name you ask it to save it as. Also whenever you save or copy, it will use whatever rectangle you last drew, or the whole picture if no rectangle was selected. Oh and lastly the 'Refresh' button loads whatever is currently in the clip-board into QuickConvert, this way you can leave it open while you take screen-shots and quick jump back to it, hit Refresh and then do what ever you do with it." />
