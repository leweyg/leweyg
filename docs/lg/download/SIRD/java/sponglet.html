<div id="content"><font size=3><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><h1>SIRDS Ponglet</h1><p>SPonglet is a Java applet that lets you play Pong in real-time SIRDS (commonly known as '<a href="http://www.magiceye.com">Magic-Eye</a>' images). This applet is a part of my <a href="../../../../lg/download/SIRD/index.html">AbSIRD</a> project devoted to putting SIRDS into new an interesting places. Also try 'drawing height' using <a href="absirdlet.html">AbSIRDlet</a>, another SIRDS based Java applet.</p><center><APPLET height="300" width="300" archive="SPonglet.jar" code="SPonglet.class"></APPLET><br></center><br><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0" ><tr><td><h1>How to Play</h1><p>This is a 1-player version of Pong. Both the front and back paddles are controled by the mouse. Try and hit the ball with the paddle as it reaches either of the two ends, the angle it bounces off will depend how it hit the paddle. Each time you hit the ball it will go a little faster and your objective is to get as many hits in as you can before you miss (the current hit count is shown in the status bar). When you miss your paddle freezes and you have to <b>left click again to restart the game</b>. Also you can tap the right mouse button at any time to toggle between SIRDS and height viewing mode.</p></td></tr></table><br><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0" ><tr><td><h1>About</h1><p>First of all I know this app is a little rough, I wrote it mostly as a proof of concept that you can apply the SIRDS algorithum (or at least the AbSIRD approximation of that algorithum) in real-time in Java. Mostly it's for those of you who love <a href="http://www.magiceye.com/">Magic-Eye</a> books and posters and like to see them in all kinds of interesting places like on the web. What I'm hoping is that having this applet available and putting out the source code will encourage others out there to write some interesting games that use SIRDS. To help support this idea I have also written <a href="absirdlet.html">AbSIRDlet</a> which is a simple 'height' drawingsame using the same SIRDS code as SPonglet.</p><p>I also have a few other SIRDS applications on my <a href="../../../../lg/download/SIRD/index.html">AbSIRD homepage</a> (this includes a <a href="../../../../lg/download/SIRD/q2/index.html">Quake 2 mod</a> allowing you to play the whole game in SIRDS). On that page you can also find an essay on the AbSIRD algorithumn and even a demo of how it can be implimented using pixel shaders.</p><p>If there is someone out there who would like to take the time to clean up this demo and make it a more game I would love to see it done and would be glad to help in any way I can. But it would be even better if you made up some new game of your own. Possibly adapt one of the great old classic puzzles games SIRDS.</p></td></tr></table><br><table bgcolor="#f0f0c0" ><tr><td><h1>Download</h1><p>This is the builds and source code for both <a href="absirdlet.html">AbSIRDlet</a> and <a href="sponglet.html">SPonglet</a>. Please note that ZDraw.java is shared between the two applets. Also keep in mind that this source code was a quick proof-of-concept hack so don't consider it for lessons on how to write good code. I only put it here to help others in writing their own SIRDS implimentations.</p><p>If you have any trouble, questions or comments please feel free to email me at <a href="lewey@lewcid.com">lewey@lewcid.com</a>. Also if you use this code to write your own project I would love to hear about it.</p><table bgcolor="#f0c0c0"><tr><td><center><a href="jAbSIRD.zip"><font size=5><i>jAbSIRD.zip</i></font></a></center><br><b>Platform: </b> Java Applet<br><b>Note:</b> Includes source code<br></td></tr></table><br></td></tr></table><br></td></tr></table></font>
