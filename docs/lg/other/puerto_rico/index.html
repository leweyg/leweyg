<br><img src="Set2/MeAtTop.jpg"><br>

Lorraine's comment: Look a squished frog!<br>
Lewey's comment: I would like to add that I protested this image from being added to this page, Lorraine however insisted. If there is anyone else out there who sees why this image should not be on this page, please know that I totally agree with you.<br>
Lorraine's final comment: I win.<br>

<br><img src="Set2/YesReally.jpg"><br>
Yes this is actually what it looks like, and yes it does actually exist, it is infact a fence.<br>

<br><img src="Set2/YesReally_CloseUp.jpg"><br>

Experience the amazing thrills of Toro Negro!!!<br>
