  that has been called “hard sci-fi”, and was written primarily to help me
  organize my thinking around future computer interfaces, how they would be
  used, why they would be used, and how those components can be told while
  focusing on the situation. It was written quickly around the 30<sup>th</sup> of Dec
  2011. <br/><br/>

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>I see my home as an open spirular structure on a colossal water
  droplet, dangling in space, weightlessly supporting another 20,000 lives, as
  do the other bubbles in our spherical block, along this arm of cold space
  stretching almost endlessly behind the rotating comet.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>In the morning I watch the droplets land as the blue constellations
  of vapor fall onto the glass barrier window. A white timeline and calendar
  extend from the droplets reflection of me. 2067; three months until our
  product goes comet-wide; currently in the first week of stage 2 stabilizer
  tuning; about half a comet season until the warmer radial shift; two and a
  half years before the timeline of my next personal goal completes; and 12
  seconds until my suit and shoes fit themselves correctly.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Pulling out of hover dock, my trusty Space Rover is joined by
  thousands of others, streaming into the cloud of city-sized rotating
  buildings.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“Here’s your coffee, and if its news to you, those new comet’s-edge
  farming crops are coming in mighty fine, your team has a plan to support that
  sort of thing yes? Well good, and move on, I can’t help you all day.”</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Two parallel windows held in front of me a hand-cut mechanical clock,
  and Keller Williams, with arms stretched out toward the further plane. He
  grabbed a small holographic link from a long chain, and threw his arms open,
  expanding the chain a thousand times into the great machinations of what appeared
  to be a bronze valley of clockwork cogs filling the glass for over twice our
  height.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“It’s just a mechanical metaphor for the engine’s cooling software; we’re
  trying to figure out what can be cut to reach the 100K cycles per second necessary
  for the dynamic covers to balance in equilibrium over the intakes.” I nodded
  in agreement, as the heavy bronze components did indeed physicalize the
  multitude of vital tasks and readings each balancer must undertake every
  magnetic cycle; and each appeared as necessary as the next. My hand reached
  out, and tilted down, rotating the wall of clockwork cogs into discs and then
  lines of light overlapping and sparking between each other; my hand then pushed
  forward, driving each to be further and smaller while visually zooming the
  sparks into rhythmic patterns and out further through multiple spirular algorithms
  until the complete holographic model of the intake-cover hovered almost
  silently before us. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“Have you tried rescaling your timeline to the fundamental ‘Dance’
  frequency from the motion sensors themselves?” I said, relaxing my hand to
  let the clockwork forest reappear, and watching the cogs fly across the room by
  my recommendation, reforming into clusters of similar computations, and now
  reducing themselves by shared assumptions on similar sensor readings. The
  result was promising, but even after reduction it implied a response time only
  slightly shorter than the previous model. “Ah, so that’s why they have <i>you</i>
  working on this; it’s a tricky one indeed.”</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Keller nodded slowly “the fundamental clock tick of the machine, regardless
  of your use for it as a hovering step ladder, is still the clearest way to
  find the essential work to be done” he said as the original cog configuration
  clicked back into place. However he did begrudgingly flick some of them into
  a new configuration, ticked the threshold as a little closer to met, and then
  extended a hand in my direction, “And as always Lawrence, a good morning to
  you too.”</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>I sat contentedly staring out of my window at the determined walk of
  a well-dressed business woman, while the day’s communications appeared by the
  side of my reflection. My eyes imitating that certain “<i>façon de voir</i>”
  (pattern of eye movement) particular to the feminine confidence exhibited by
  my muse, I quickly glanced through the general and team news, eyes flick-tagging
  and then finally settling into the more complex issues surrounding my particular
  role.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Our team’s meeting notification slid into place. While still within easy
  reach, I threw some of our latest results and progresses into a crude communication,
  and mapped it into my jacket pocket in case this meeting required some punch.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“For the last 20 years, Structured Matter Corporation has supplied
  the connectivity crystals that built these walls and 80% of the walls along
  the comet’s tail”, the comet stood holographically spiraling upwards in the
  center of the 30 person round-table meeting room. “Our clientele are no
  longer the practically minded construction engineers building towards basic
  survival on the first colonizable water comet, they are now connoisseurs of
  space.”</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Gregory Sharp’s arm swept over the room expanding the comet’s path
  into a timeline striped diagonally with symbols of SMC’s major products. From
  release, to growing adoption, and most often to replacement, their
  overlapping growth had held the company in its famous upward slope. His eyes
  held the thinning section at the near end of the timeline, and then followed
  his toe to inspect the floor beneath us. “Our pioneering relative location
  matrices, and self-healing barrier walls, are now common practice; quickly
  overlooked in favor of deeper immersion sensory stimulation carpeting. They
  have literally pulled the rug from under us, and it is proving to be some
  fine engineering to compete with.”</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>My hand touched the notes in my jacket pocket, as the small time-strip
  representing our Fire Walker technology glowed along the timeline, and then
  expanded into the full circumference of the room. Gregory continued, “But
  this team is not competing to keep customers padded together in
  megapartments, nor to hasten the monotonic sprawl of SMC’s previous products
  across fields of identical suburban satellites.” The strip transformed into a
  giant metallic shard-like-wing as clouds of holographic fire slipped around
  and enclosed it’s surface, a tense quiver of rapid shudders followed, when
  the shard suddenly caught weightlessly its own drag and rolled quietly over
  the searing waves of cosmic particles.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“Fire Walker, or Dynamic Response Architecture, is a million buildings
  in one, dynamically switching between them, to surf the cosmic tides with
  ease.” Looking from the model to the eyes around the room “This team’s role
  is to create for specific clients the first and showcase buildings of this
  new technology. I repeat our mission statement now to stress the balance
  between a successful building, and the long term success of Fire Walker
  technology in general, which this team was formed to support.” Heads nodded
  as the projects time-strip reappeared and extended into the future. Our
  projected increase in production rose over time, with the products
  constituting that progress visually streaming from the representative people
  around the room into the shared rising pool, and beyond those shorter
  timelines into an eventual estimated one third of the companies investments. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>I watched my piece of the jigsaw click into one of the larger streams
  ending within the next year, and noticed its small “acknowledged ripple”
  flowing into neighboring and future products. I saw the fellow across from me
  stare into the endless corridors of detail within his single piece.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“It’s more than a million static buildings in one.” I said as the
  eyes centered on me. “And it’s not only about our particular clients spoken
  wants either. This requires a new kind of relationship between the person and
  the forms around them, one which embraces the dynamic nature of both, beyond
  that of a static wall.” The projected timeline centering the room spiraled
  rapidly outwards but quickly lost its resolution as the specific nature of the
  new relationship was ill defined, and led to grey loose possibilities. I
  reached for the notes in my jacket, but realized they would only extend the
  projection a few notches further, nothing particularly more compelling, yet.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Gregory’s hand closed, pulling the timeline into a linear perspective
  showing its actual location within this building, within this cloud of
  commercial buildings, and between swarms of transport vehicles swimming
  through current-time. “Lawrence is right; it is not just the prediction
  plots, but rather the relationship of a man’s existence to his surroundings here
  and now that provides the ultimate purpose of this organization.” The holo
  space automatically zoomed into a building and then chiseled face of Harold
  Zeem, the famous actor we had hired to model for our better products. White architectural
  lines following his Vitruvian features extended out and accented his form as
  they curled into the space around him, rotating out to form our latest in
  modern custom-fit planar disc homes. The Structured Matter Corporations’ SMC banner
  followed.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“Perhaps when Lawrence is finished, those walls will dynamically
  adapt rather than statically reinforce the signature poses and physical
  productivity tasks we’ve provided.” The lines of the building attempted to
  follow Zeem’s body as he confidently strode towards the window, stretching
  and contracting every wall through fascinating undulations, but ultimately sticking
  on rigid coils and corridors as the sharp planar windows extended no more.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“Well, there is certainly plenty room to grow there. On to the
  business updates…”</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>I find lunch to be a very personal experience, while often shared
  with friends, today I sit with a rich soup, on a sofa window near my office.
  The next three weeks schedule lightly stretches across the windows length,
  while along its height are marked my personal team member’s timelines with a
  waterfall of connecting “trade flow” lines showing the complex dependency
  chains between their work and the products target.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>My soup spoon acts as a pointing device while I flick newly received
  bug reports and partner requests onto the appropriate team members’ calendars.
  Stopping, I unfold my hand up into an open palm, and slowly rotate about the
  wrist; the sequential days rotating with my hand until each column represents
  a task, here and there intersecting the rows of people to whom they are
  assigned. From this perspective it is clear that many similar items assigned
  to others should go to me, and that Nimja and Karl should be doing two
  different kinds of bolt motion calibration rather than both pulling from the
  same list and alternating types. Each of these process changes finds
  expression between snappy spoon flicks and mouthfuls of soup.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“Gentlemen, and lady, thank you for meeting me in my office, along
  with our friend Heath joining holographically from the hardware plant. The
  results of our last week’s sprint were duly impressive in the stakeholders
  meeting, and we are encouraged to finish the efforts. Now, keeping in mind
  that this is a recorded contractual meeting, let us begin.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“We have before us four weeks of vital development, three of which
  will decide the last.” The empty calendar tile stretched four weeks long in
  the center of the crowded room. “During these weeks there are six major parallel
  tasks we must accomplish, represented by the columns now cutting that time
  thin.” I then pushed down the nearest corner, separating the tasks into a
  stack of sheets, creating a separate plane for each member of the team. Nimja
  unfolded one hand from his arms, opened it to select only his slate, and
  twisted it into closer inspection. “While you consider the plan, I will begin
  ‘lowering’ the room to the outer lab rungs of the SMC center.”</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“…so the bolts between shards cannot withstand the Walker’s stresses for
  long, unless they are specifically built or ‘trained’ to do so; and you want
  us to train them from your flight data?” Karl concluded as we arrived into
  the gigantic bare megaplate walls of SMC test chamber 72.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“Exactly; simply correlate the structure templates to known thresholds,
  and then of course… live test it.”</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>We now stood beside the “Long Arm” inflatable construction suit,
  which looked like a backpack mounted to a hang-glider’s wing, trailed by a
  deflated hot air balloon.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“Not everybody likes the ‘Arm suit, but it’s necessary to build at
  the inter shard scale.” I flicked the backpack’s handles tight on either side
  of me, buckled in, and flexed my right arm out to the side. Kinesthetic
  tracking engaged as the 20-foot long arm inflated and whipped into place,
  twisting and contorting via the area optimized contracting bands squeezing
  the inflated canvas muscles.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>My left hand inflated into place as I steadied myself for the “weird”
  part of manual pneumatic robotics: standing. Carefully lifting my right knee
  under me, and inflating my left leg back, I lunge forward some 100-feet,
  landing and catching myself on semi-solid bending legs, while somewhat
  logically waving my arms around like gigantic sail oars, to twist into a
  caught position somewhere between kneeling and push-ups from which I can
  eventually stand.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Stretching the 30-foot legs over each side of the next metal wing, I
  counter swing the weight up into the air above my head, carrying the almost
  40x60x10-foot edged shard of Fire Walker Shapeware Steel, to be installed as
  the left breast plate of the Fire Walker suit itself.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>More cosmic knife than space suit, I explicitly designed the Fire
  Walker craft akin to the human form to allow the maximum control possible
  when balancing a 360-foot tall collection of shapeware wings loosely bolted
  together and hovering upon the ebbs and flows of a comet’s fiery tail. With
  six torso shards, three shards per limb, and two for the head, it stands as a
  floating scar of humanized metal plates; that could construct a building a
  hundred times its own size, in the middle of a cosmic hailstorm.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Later that day in my office, the holographic Fire Walker simulation
  is replicating my coffee sipping arm while balancing over a virtual cosmic
  well of falling fiery particles. The hind leg stabilizers in their bicycling
  uplift pattern are missing every 12<sup>th</sup> or so downward kick, very peculiar.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Swanly stepped to the door between the office corridor and the
  eternal well of space below us. “You heard that our friends at Beveled
  Carpeting are producing adaptable wall planes yes?” said he, rolling his toe
  over the doors edge.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“Their dichotomy of interior and exterior is so often the cause of
  innumerable arguments.” I replied as the Walker’s exposed hovering shards
  caught a broken ripple of light.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“Hey! Sensory stimulation carpeting gives the customers the feel they
  want; what’s the point in asking why they want it...” He continued staring
  distantly at the complex mechanical balancing act.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“…must you always design OF the human form but never FOR them? Cannot
  their whimsical pleasures be more deeply rooted in your physical product?” pleaded
  Swanly pulling in his shoulders.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“I should ask you that” tilting my head back and to the side.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“[Sigh]. Every day I wonder over and talk to you, and it’s always the
  biggest riddle of my hours. My personal thrills are apparently a mysterious
  driving force I may never understand.” He scoffed.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“Some questions come before others” said I drawing with my finger the
  symbol for the subconscious auto-mapping of experience to emotion, and the conscious
  but optional control thereof, and then staring out into the cosmos. “Oh I saw
  Bevels new foot driven roller flooring, very impressive” but the words only
  caught his sloppily turning shoulders.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>My eyes rested on the open door, leading back to current-time.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>“What are you looking for?” bubbled Julia rounding the corner and
  glancing from the far corridor through to me, while my legs back pedaled from
  holo space and up against the side wall.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Every fingertip twisting and weaving the knot of interleaved
  holo-strings representing both the Walker’s stability equations, the people
  doing the work to implement them, and their ultimate consequences across the
  company and comet’s infrastructure was simply too much for me to take as I
  threw the incomplete and knotted holo ball at a passing highway spoke, and
  watched it shoot into the receding distance while pulling my shoulders back and
  breath up and out.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>My raised eyes watched blankly the passing megafields of non-linear
  sun-berry trees stretching endlessly into a naturally intricate and ever
  individually structured gravityless growth. Their harvesting had always been
  a huge challenge, but that was part of their appeal, if indeed they could be
  addressed as a single group at all.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Staring across the narrow trolley to the warmly jacketed woman across
  from me, my worries of work correctly faded into the whirling power of the
  mag engines presumably taking her home, and myself to the art institute.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>The exterior corridor of the institute ran along its side a history
  of intraformal sculpture.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Preceded sequentially by the invention of augmented visual overlays,
  and the proliferation of sub-surface tensile stress visualizers, the sculptor
  and his audience had found pleasing the intricate analysis of torques,
  pressures and physical composition systems now viscerally apparent to the senses.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Indeed upon retroactive analysis of the great masters, particularly
  their uncast clay originals, but also infamously their marble carvings, each
  internal structure did little but to solidify the works place in history.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Eventual acceptance of conceptual holigraphy, by which one interactively
  knots and then untangles across their physical, communicated and
  philosophical lives, added the crowning touch to sculptural appreciation,
  making visible each viewers troubles and thoughts as manifest on the
  physicalized forms’ near trembling internal structure.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>The actual matter of my intra-sculpture, as an expressively isolating
  and painfully selective physical recreation process; is a shocking implosion
  of honest effort into an honestly obvious existent that is hardly expressible
  in words.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Foo Long graciously places my succulent meal and beer on the table,
  before bowing with a smile, as he and the hours of sculpture now rest far
  behind me. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:

  stop by my bubble.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>Deep inside, she is standing with her right foot a little to her
  side, and her head thrown high, staring past the stone awning and glass sheets
  she herself had cut. Her hands at her sides, palms forward, gradually
  extending back and sensuously enclosing each finger over the intra-rock force
  lines she had molded for herself to be held within. Catching her whole body
  on the magnetic fields, she slowly arches up and into the thin air with full
  rising confidence.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
  normal'>My left hand traces along her back and shoulders, as my spine
  straightens into a floating ease, filling her eyes and senses as my only
  purpose, while finding myself gradually falling into her magnetic cloud,
  electrified lips, and arched back; burning a clean pocket of living calm, as
  a small glowing light, in a <br>
  droplet of space.</p>
