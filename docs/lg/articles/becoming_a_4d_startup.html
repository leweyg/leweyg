<p class="c6"><span class="c7 c1 c0">Becoming a 4D Startup</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Rapid summary </span><span class="c0">of </span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="../../">Lewcid.com</a></span><span class="c2 c0">&rsquo;s first year of business: 2018</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">12 months ago I founded a &ldquo;4D&rdquo; startup. Having just left Lucasfilm&rsquo;s Virtual Reality department, and before that Microsoft&rsquo;s Mixed Reality team, I felt the call to build what I considered the big missing piece: a complete space+time/multi-dimensional interface, able to express the spatial, temporal and conceptual relationships that implicitly tie our world together, and which had not yet been brought to interactive light. Looking back now I understand why the path lead me into cryptographically secured spatial contracts with </span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.verses.io/">Verses.io</a></span><span class="c0">, how that ties into every physical movement and emotion with phantom-pain VR therapy group </span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="http://karunavr.com/">KarunaVR.com</a></span><span class="c0">, how the very soil beneath us will turn transparent thanks to ground penetrating radar on-demand company </span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.maptopia.city/">MapTopia.City</a></span><span class="c0">, how numerous social and personal biofeedback products will revolutionize our relationships to each other, how this introduces one to people creating new holistic business and investment models, and ultimately how it will all flow together into a new kind of economic/ecosystem harmony of spatial agreements communicated across apps, web, augmented reality, biofeedback, community ledgers, and autonomous systems existing in tune with the nature around us. I have grown personally and professionally, and put down here the public summary of </span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="../../">Lewcid System</a></span><span class="c2 c0">&rsquo;s first year, 2018, as we prepare for the spatial decade ahead&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">Step 1: Get/Make/Define 4-Dimensionality</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">Step 2: Get Content and Clients</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">Step 3: Rethink Infrastructure with Verses.io</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">Step 4: Think in the Trillions!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">Step 5: Bring it into the Body</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">Step 6: Rethink Community</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0 c1">Step 1: Get/Make/Define 4-Dimensionality</span><span class="c0">: My first step was getting &ldquo;</span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="http://www.4dprocess.com/4d/index.html">4D</a></span><span class="c2 c0">&rdquo; working; that means taking all this experience in high-end 3D game engines, and all this practise on medical and financial quality data visualization, and combining them until little icons on a 2d map can be lifted up and extruded into a 3D model of space and time the user can hold virtually in their hand (for example: many people condense into the city by day, and leave at night, this creates a sort of pulse or tree shape when seen in 4D). Conceptual research in 4D processes was a deep focus, from how the daily circadian rhythms of the human body establish a time-coded holistic cycle and variety of needs, to the seasonal patterns of agricultural planning, to the larger world economic patterns which reflect that resource growth, to the even larger ecological succession models of how plants transform rocks into forests over centuries. The code also grew cleanly, prototyped visually in Unreal, then structurally explored in C#, performance tuned in Unity, which informed the JavaScript browser renderer, while the database bridges got cleaned and moved into a server, and the core JSON structures were all that really remained. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">Step 2: Get Content and Clients</span><span class="c0">: starting with the numerous open-data catalogs and companies from my researches, the first big surprise was how little of today&#39;s data and internet standards are actually configured for spatialization, or for holistic integration at all. Actually mapping modern business records to literal who/where/what geo-temporal graphs required writing custom AI bots to crawl databases and cross-correlate + geocode those into spatially meaningful relationships (from a sales invoice, to the item type, to the manufacturer, to where+when they actually arrived at the warehouse and were sent to the customer location, as well as where the sales calls were made from etc.). My first pro-bono clients from the ecosystem awareness scene in San Francisco were wild-cacao growers wanting to express the richness of their forest cultivated beans, as well as big organizations like </span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.regen.network/">Regen.Network</a></span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;helping identify true ecologically positive land-stewards through satellite analysis of biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Some additional clients in the blockchain space started paying the bills through these visualizations&hellip; but something was missing&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">Step 3: Rethink Infrastructure with </span><span class="c5 c1 c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.verses.io/">Verses.io</a></span><span class="c2 c0">: even though I&rsquo;d heard about Verses, the click didn&rsquo;t happen until reading some of their investor-only materials, when I finally got it: the trick to geo-temporal integration of the economy wasn&rsquo;t just in the visualization, it was in reliable spatial contracts between entities, and how you find and interact with those is the spatial querying protocol, so combine the querying with the contracts and you have the actual spatialized language of the future internet economy! This is how people will literally offer and exchange with each other, an open network of spatial rights, routes and rituals. Groups like Uber/UPS/AirBnB are based on spatial contracts, trading for space and time; they are just expressed within closed routing platforms, what will happen when cross-industry spatial economics are fully enabled? I flew to LA, interviewed, and took an offer on the first day, and am now the Director of Spatial Technologies, where I run multiple AR/web3d/map front ends, help define the core spatial querying and contracting protocols, and manage the numerous backends from local bluetooth ledgers, to cloud and super secure blockchain real-estate servers, all coordinated in our cross-ledger unified protocol. Walking through one of our partners massive warehouses, testing our AR spatial tasking framework down to the inch, watching that update in realtime on 3d web pages, while allowing the boxes to own themselves across international supply chains, and tieing all that into holistic routing systems, it&rsquo;s clear that the future currency will be reality itself. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">Step 4: Think in the Trillions</span><span class="c0">! &nbsp;If you start estimating the number of tracked goods, even just bar-codes used in the world today, you start most calculations in the trillions. There is a lot going on out there, and while scalability is built into our protocol, using the same principles as zooming on a 2d map and search relevance, the actual business people who one talks to can be quite mind boggling: from AirBnB and Uber users to understand the on-demand spatial market, to store stockers and construction teams who label every location with unique codes, to beacon and computer vision based trackers who charge you as you pickup an item, to massive Japanese vertical conglomerates who have never actually seen their whole company as one, to our spatial mapping business partner </span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.esri.com/">ESRI</a></span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;who power the maps we&rsquo;ll be turning into interactive economies, and ultimately to the conscious investors and financial directors out there desperately trying to help the ecosystem and looking for quantifiable angles of approach. The will of all these people to make a better world is apparent, but it has to be done at scale, in carefully, visually, and economically orchestrated spatial contracts.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">Step 5: Bring it into the Body</span><span class="c0">: While the pain of the Earth is largely caused by knotted supply chains and business models; so does this same pattern occur in the body. </span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="http://karunavr.com/">Karuna Labs</a></span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;has been developing Virtual Reality pain therapy for years now, helping people see and control virtual phantom limbs, and even more vital at a larger scale helping hindered users see phantom-range-of-motion: where those who can move only a little, can see that motion exaggerated slightly, and start to literally see their body do more, get past the pain associated with that movement, and extend to what they believe they are now able to do. It works surprisingly well, a good reflection of the same idea in the economics space, and of course is fun and presented in a safe space. While I wrote some of the initial phantom limb code pro-bono, now that they are fully funded I&rsquo;ve taken a little time to ensure that the product grows to its full potential. Motion and sensor based biofeedback is a deep passion of mine, as ultimately the concept of augmented motion will integrate with our social, spatial and biological and contracts to give real depth of context and purpose to artificial limbs and intelligence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">Step 6: Rethink Community</span><span class="c2 c0">: The goal behind all this work is of course a more peaceful, explicit, efficient and empowered community experience. From helping visually coordinate underground utility departments for the City of San Francisco, to Reno smart-city leasing models where blockchain constitutes legal ownership, to helping drone associations formalizing spatial flight contracts, or to being invited to talk with the Department of Homeland Security and TSA/Customs about how distributed identity and spatial contracts could be the new passports, to global human rights and sustainability movements that are tieing all these relationships into actionable steps forward for humanity. I feel proud to be offering my part, helping people see the spatial truth implied in the symbolic transactions and agreements they have been making; and finding my place, sometimes working a booth at a Yoga festival in Joshua Tree, and sometimes wearing a suit on a rented yacht on the Toronto harbor, but always looking to help those around me find harmony within themselves and their relations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">If you would like to learn about, utilize or get involved with any of these projects, please feel free to reach out and I&rsquo;ll be glad to direct you to the right parties. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">I&rsquo;d also like to thank, in addition to the great teams mentioned above, the Lewcid Systems internal team, who have been with me throughout this time: </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0 c5"><a class="c4" href="https://worldbridger.org/">David Tejeda</a></span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;- my Dr.Strange-like consultant on holistic thinking and multidimensionality.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="https://allisoncrady.com/">Allison Crady</a></span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;- super-objective User Centric Research and Design lead.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">And most importantly, my partner in life, the infinite </span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="http://suzanneastar.com/">Suzanne Astar</a></span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0 c2">Until next year, yours,</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">- Lewey Geselowitz</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">Director of Spatial Technologies - </span><span class="c5 c1 c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.verses.io/">Verses.io</a></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">Advisor / Acting-CTO - </span><span class="c5 c1 c0"><a class="c4" href="http://karunavr.com/">KarunaVR.com</a></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Advisor / Director-of-Visualization - </span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.maptopia.city/">MapTopia.City</a></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">CEO - Lewcid Systems - </span><span class="c5 c0"><a class="c4" href="../../">Lewcid.com</a></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
